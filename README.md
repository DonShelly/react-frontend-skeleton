# Tips and code slices

### Capture Additional Errors
You can manually capture errors or log additional data using Sentry:
```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';

try {
  // Your code here
} catch (error) {
  Sentry.captureException(error);
}
```

### Adding More Detailed Error Logging in Error Boundaries
You can enhance your ErrorBoundary to send more detailed information to Sentry when an error occurs:

```javascript
componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
  // Log to Sentry
  Sentry.captureException(error, {
    extra: errorInfo,
  });
}
```

### Setting Up Performance Monitoring
Sentry can also monitor application performance by tracking things like load times, transaction spans, and more. The initial configuration youâ€™ve already set up includes performance monitoring via the tracesSampleRate option.

You can track specific operations in your app:

```javascript
const transaction = Sentry.startTransaction({ name: "My Transaction" });

Sentry.configureScope(scope => {
  scope.setSpan(transaction);
});

// Your code here

transaction.finish();
```

### Use these env variables in your app:

```javascript
const apiUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL;
```




# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
